You should know different libraries like: RxJS, jQuery, Handlebars, Angular, React. You should know different Architectures like: MVC, Redux, Flux. You'll also need to know some build pipeline tools like: Webpack, Babel, Traceur, Minifiers, Grunt/Gulp. There are also many styling tools like: LESS, SASS, etc.
